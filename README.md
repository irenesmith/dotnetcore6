# .NET Core 6.0

A repository for playing around with .NET Core 6 projects.

Projects in this repository:

- [ASP.NET Core 6.0 with React](AspNetCoreWithReact/) - Created for a Udemy
  course.
- [Entertainment](Entertainment/) - First steps playing with C# 10 and .NET Core 6.0.
  When finished, this will be a CRUD application to maintain a list of our entertainment
  including movies, TV shows, books, and video games.
- [Core 6 with Main](Core6WithMain/) - Just a quick application that looks like a .NET
  5 application but includes a namespace, a Program class, and a Main method.
- [New FizzBuzz] - An implementation of FizzBuzz programming challenge created using the
  switch expression which is available in .NET 5 and 6. Notice that by using top-level
  statements, it's reduced the size of the C# file (FizzBuzz.cs) to 10 lines of code.
